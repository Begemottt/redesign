# RTVGilder Redesign
This is another redesign of my personal website, which I am never quite satisfied with. This time, I'm gonna go for full React integration, with a headless CMS using ~~Directus~~ GraphCMS. I used it for a school project before, so I know it has a nice interface and will be easy to reuse if I end up redesigning _again_ at a later time, haha.

  Overall, I'm planning on using:

- React
- webpack
- Sass
- anime.js
- GraphCMS
- React Router

Going to work on the organization of my SCSS this time. I never really utilize all of its features. And use more React stuff, I've realized that I neglect a lot of its capabilities as well. But, overall, I'm not much of a flashy coder. The idea here is to make something _aesthetically_ interesting, if it runs well that's just a nice bonus!

The plan is to make a single-page site, with permalink URLs. I've seen it done before, but it was in a class back in the spring of 2020. But I know I can figure it out for myself.

Things are going well so far, I've got the navigation bar styled up how I like it. Defintiely gonna go for more of an asymmetric and skeuomorphic style this time. It feels right, somehow. The connection to GraphCMS is working great, but now I need to figure out how to get react router working the way I want it to. That's going to involve getting deep into how it handles movement to new pages, to trigger those functions exactly when and how I want, so I can have page transition animations.
