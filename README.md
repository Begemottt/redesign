# RTVGilder Redesign
This is another redesign of my personal website, which I am never quite satisfied with. This time, I'm gonna go for full React integration, with a headless CMS using ~~Directus~~ GraphCMS. I used it for a school project before, so I know it has a nice interface and will be easy to reuse if I end up redesigning _again_ at a later time, haha.

  Overall, I'm planning on using:

- React
- webpack
- Sass
- anime.js
- GraphCMS
- Axios

Going to work on the organization of my SCSS this time. I never really utilize all of its features. And use more React stuff, I've realized that I neglect a lot of its capabilities as well. But, overall, I'm not much of a flashy coder. The idea here is to make something _aesthetically_ interesting, if it runs well that's just a nice bonus!

The plan is to make a single-page site, with permalink URLs. I've seen it done before, but it was in a class back in the spring of 2020. But I know I can figure it out for myself.
