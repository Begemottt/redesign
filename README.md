# RTVGilder Redesign
This is another redesign of my personal website, which I am never quite satisfied with. This time, I'm gonna go for full React integration, with a headless CMS using Directus. I was turned onto the whole Jamstack thing, and it seems like exactly what I want for my site. Nothing too fancy, just a nice, basic API with a graphical interface.

  Overall, I'm planning on using:

- React
- webpack
- Sass
- anime.js
- Directus (or some other headless CMS)
- Axios

Going to work on the organization of my SCSS this time. I never really utilize all of its features. And use more React stuff, I've realized that I neglect a lot of its capabilities as well. But, overall, I'm not much of a flashy coder. The idea here is to make something _aesthetically_ interesting, if it runs well that's just a nice bonus!

The plan is to make a single-page site, with permalink URLs. I've seen it done before, but it was in a class back in the spring of 2020. But I know I can figure it out for myself.
